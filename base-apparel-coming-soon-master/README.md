## My work on this project.
Layout the page on mobile and desktop to continue with the next step, which was to make the logic in JavaScript.

## learnings
some problems that cost me a little more time than expected.
One of those problems was getting the image to switch from mobile to desktop, which was a photo with more picellation as well as getting it to reposition itself.
The second problem I had was how to validate the mail. but I solved this by spending a little time to investigate,

### Conclusions
I feel that doing these projects on your own helps a lot to advance your learning, because you also dedicate time to investigate and have your solutions. no matter what problem you have in a certain problem.
